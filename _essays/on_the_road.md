## Day 5.  10.03.2022
A group of cool students let me stay with them for a week, so I'm leaving my friendly neighborhood hostel.

A snow storm ramps up, and miniature snowflakes are instantly melting when they hit the asphalt. To celebrate this, the cafe placed a personal heater under my feet.
After figuring out how to say "1 coffee" in turkish, I was eager to whisper these words to get a cup of excellent cup of ground "kahve", which I sampled last time here.
Lord knows the reasons for this, but my words were interpreted as a wish for a cup of metallic-tasting instant "nescafe".
How a country, which cares deeply about this particular beverage, can do that to a human being is beyond me.

Apartment is a two story aparment, standing on a tight slope. 
Second floor is not level and has enough space inside to host a population of mice. Regarding their survival in the city of cats, my bet is that abundant cat food, scattered around the streets is also edible by other species.

A comfy place all in all, even without a mother figure, who wouldn't leave slices of avocado alone to decompose without a proper burial. 
## Day 6.  11.03.2022
Visited a party for russian expats.
They felt like foreigners who just happen to speak the same language.

Personally, party's redeeming point was a bunch of non-russians, with moustaches and without. 
Saw a charming place which was selling Turkish style baked potatoes.
At 12am customers receiving steaming hot, belly open potatoe full of stuff seemed magical, how did I convice myself to not buy one?
## Day 7.  12.03.2022
I've been relying on Starbucks for a workplace a lot, which feels like a familliar western crutch in the land of million local coffee caves.

Picked a burger joint because they were blasing remixes of Eminem's old classics, and their competitor across the street didn't.
