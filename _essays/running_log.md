## Day 5.  10.03.2022
A group of cool students let me stay with them for a week, so I'm leaving my friendly neighborhood hostel.

A snow storm ramps up, and miniature snowflakes are instantly melting when they hit the asphalt. To celebrate this, the cafe placed a personal heater under my feet.
After figuring out how to say "1 coffee" in turkish, I was eager to whisper these words to get a cup of excellent cup of ground "kahve", which I sampled last time here.
Lord knows the reasons for this, but my words were interpreted as a wish for a cup of metallic-tasting instant "nescafe".
How a country, which cares deeply about this particular beverage, can do that to a human being is beyond me.

Apartment is a two story aparment, standing on a tight slope. 
Second floor is not level and has enough space inside to host a population of mice. Regarding their survival in the city of cats, my bet is that abundant cat food, scattered around the streets is also edible by other species.

A comfy place all in all, even without a mother figure, who wouldn't leave slices of avocado alone to decompose without a proper burial. 
## Day 6.  11.03.2022
Visited a party for russian expats.
They felt like foreigners who just happen to speak the same language.

Personally, party's redeeming point was a bunch of non-russians, with moustaches and without. 
Saw a charming place which was selling Turkish style baked potatoes.
At 12am customers receiving steaming hot, belly open potatoe full of stuff seemed magical, how did I convince myself to not buy one?
## Day 7.  12.03.2022
Today I'm relying on Starbucks as a workplace, which feels like a familiar western crutch in the land of million local coffee caves.

Picked a burger joint because they were blasting remixes of Eminem's old classics, and their competitor across the street didn't.

Caught a moment where it felt like the whole world is against me. 
Everyone I wrote to, didn't respond to my messages, and I was imagining the absolute worst in others. Then suddenly, I got a barrage of enthusiastic, warm replies.
Why it's so easy to start expecting the worst in people?

On the way back home, I hear a loud crack in the distance. Is today a holiday? Haven't seen any fireworks here yet. 
A minute later, a guy stops me in Turkish and then in English, saying I shouldn't go forward, as he saw someone running with a gun. 
A black mass of 20-30 people are moving erratically on a small basketball court in the park on my way.

it's still snowing, a few strangers, engaged in snowball fights, have thrown snowballs in my direction. In Russia it would feel rather hostile, but not here.

Our neighborhood has a lot of kids riding the slopes on plastic bags. That looks so joyous, that I join them, go too fast, fumble, crash into a sidewalk stairs and roll on the slope, hitting a few bones painfully enough, to start using smaller slopes.
I don't remember seeing whole neighborhoods participating in such snow galore. A christmas spirit.

## Day 8.  13.03.2022

A friend invited me to a local Soho House for breakfast.
In there, three French speakers(fluently conversing in English for my sake) casually trashed English language, noting how it's lacking beauty, elegance, or anything really.

Caught a cold. Allowing myself to rest instead of constantly stressing about rent and banks and jobs.

## Day 9.  14.03.2022

Had to leave last home for another one. More students, more foreign accents. Found a nice Lebanese restaurant. 
Sleeping on a sofa.

## Day 10.  15.03.2022

Making chinese style congee. Flatmates liked it so much, they've finished the pot in one go, and gave me a questionable nickname. "A christmas miracle".

## Day 11.  16.03.2022

The Grand Bazaar. Beautiful architecture filled to the brim with souvenirs and cracking GUCCI letters, stretched by millions of shirts.

## Day 12.  17.03.2022

"The more productive you wanna be, the more schedule of your days should look like Groundhog Day."
My days are almost the opposite of that.

## Day 13.  18.03.2022

Met a friend DV from Saint-Petersburg, on a random Istanbul alley. This city is the world, in some ways.

Met another friend from Moscow, on purpose. He brought me working UnionPay cards, which has a calming effect. I haven't managed to successfully withdraw any cash from cards yet, but that seems like a minor thing.

Met DV at potatoe place and discussed a few essays worth of ideas.

Rave. Enjoyed mediocre music and getting sloshed.

## Day 14.  19.03.2022

Rode a tram for the first time, to get to the Archaeology Museum.

Museum of whatever is left from people long dead.
They were rich and powerful. They were afraid to be forgotten, and spent riches to etch themselves into memories of others. 
Now they are dust, and soon the memory will be dust as well.
Just like me, or anyone else.

During this 2 weeks, meeting new people and making friends was easier than ever. 
English language persona is well suited for that

## Day 15.  20.03.2022

A rooster outside of my window, is announcing the passing of every half-hour, instead of the expected sunrise moment.

Met with M for breakfast, I have never seen Pippi Longstocking in real life before.
Every native language provides their own flavor of utterances.  When people speak english as a second language, they bring these utterances with them.
During these brief moments, they are talking to you in their native tongue, and revealing something, that no English word can express.

“It is no nation that we inhabit, but a language. Make no mistake; our native toungue is our true fatherland.”
― Emil Cioran 

Terraformers switched AirBnb apartments and brought me along.
Entrance is through a cheap leather bags shop, located on a busy tourist street.
This city likes layers just like it likes layers of skewered kebab.

Blockchains(and DAOs in particular) are allowing you to design, program new communities.
Even if I don't see the immediate application, it's worth diving in, once again.

## 14.03-20.03 Week review
Calming down and solving stuff one step at a time. I hope I'm not missing anything cruicial and time-sensetive. 
## 21.03-27.03 Week plan 
Need to get a a job. Even if temporary, that would bring some peace and give more time to deal with things.

## Day 16.  21.03.2022

A queue of people are shuffling around in front of the bank doors.
A short woman with a complexion of a fridge, tells me something in Turkish.
Unwilling to verbally admit no knowledge of Turkish language, I cock my head to the side. That produces a laugh.

I tell a bank guard the code, and he lets us through, skipping the queue. 
There is a good chance this adventure will get us a bank account.
 Having connections, is maybe the most valuable thing during catastrophic events.
 
Arrived at a party, where I barely knew 1 person, and never seen other 3.
10 seconds after entering the apartment, I'm realizing that the sole goal of this event, is to get utterly wasted.
Would school me appreciate that and stay? I didn't.

## Day 17.  22.03.2022

Reading "Top N essential C# Interview Questions from Big Evil" for the interivew tomorrow. 
I don't think that can change the outcome, but it makes you feel prepared.

Called B and made her realize I probably won't come back.
There was a line in Hotline Miami: "Do you like hurting other people?".
I don't like hurting this particular person so much, that for a minute,for the first time in a week, I consider returning.

A possibility to stay in a cool place for the next week has fallen through.
Can wait a couple days for 2 interview results until I make any moves.

## Day 18.  23.03.2022

Caught myself editing published entries days after. Would leaving the text in original state be more "true"?

Should this "log" have as much logging of details as possible, or be a record of just the things which surprised me?
The first option would bore me to death, fast.

Got a job offer. I got used to a problem of searching for a job.
Now I'd have to start solving problems that require money. 
Anxious thoughts of these unfamiliar problems come rushing in.
Progress should feel nice shouldn't it?

V.'s birthday, Georgian restaurant, no red wine present. Plenty of people are.

## Day 19.  24.03.2022

First time on a ferry across the Bosphorus strait. Get from one continent to another for the price of a bus ticket. 

Can't really focus on things.

## Day 20.  25.03.2022
Accepted the job offer. Getting used to an unfamiliar problem of searching for a long-term place to live.

A networking meetup for Russian expats, is a room full of "creative class":  photographers, designers, models. One sexologist.
People selling themselves with instagram accounts and there-should've-been-a-time-limit presentations, stretched by 5k+ lumen projector.
Nearby model is rocking on a chair enticingly, but portfolios presented by others?
I think I'm so sick of the russian monoculture, that all I see are spots of color. Flashes of content.

I expect to find repulsive any community of Russians with more than 2 members.
Actually a group of 2 doesn't feel neutral already.
If I interact with people of other nationalities, I can dissolve into their cultures and don't think about mine.
I don't feel it's the war to blame, but rather 27 years spent in the same jar. Lungs filled with pickle juice.

Rooftop party with pancakes. A matress is leaning against a staircase wall, presenting a local cat on top, curled in a dream.
This orange cream colored cat reminds me that my sleep pattern is a wreck, and I crawl to my sofa.

## Day 21.  26.03.2022

Spent the day locked in an apartment, searching for a rentable room on facebook groups.
There is something pleasant in focusing yourself on one thing.
 Won't be able to relax in this state anyway.
