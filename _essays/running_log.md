## Day 5.  10.03.2022
A group of cool students let me stay with them for a week, so I'm leaving my friendly neighborhood hostel.

A snow storm ramps up, and miniature snowflakes are instantly melting when they hit the asphalt. To celebrate this, the cafe placed a personal heater under my feet.
After figuring out how to say "1 coffee" in turkish, I was eager to whisper these words to get a cup of excellent cup of ground "kahve", which I sampled last time here.
Lord knows the reasons for this, but my words were interpreted as a wish for a cup of metallic-tasting instant "nescafe".
How a country, which cares deeply about this particular beverage, can do that to a human being is beyond me.

Apartment is a two story aparment, standing on a tight slope. 
Second floor is not level and has enough space inside to host a population of mice. Regarding their survival in the city of cats, my bet is that abundant cat food, scattered around the streets is also edible by other species.

A comfy place all in all, even without a mother figure, who wouldn't leave slices of avocado alone to decompose without a proper burial. 
## Day 6.  11.03.2022
Visited a party for russian expats.
They felt like foreigners who just happen to speak the same language.

Personally, party's redeeming point was a bunch of non-russians, with moustaches and without. 
Saw a charming place which was selling Turkish style baked potatoes.
At 12am customers receiving steaming hot, belly open potatoe full of stuff seemed magical, how did I convince myself to not buy one?
## Day 7.  12.03.2022
Today I'm relying on Starbucks as a workplace, which feels like a familiar western crutch in the land of million local coffee caves.

Picked a burger joint because they were blasting remixes of Eminem's old classics, and their competitor across the street didn't.

Caught a moment where it felt like the whole world is against me. 
Everyone I wrote to, didn't respond to my messages, and I was imagining the absolute worst in others. Then suddenly, I got a barrage of enthusiastic, warm replies.
Why it's so easy to start expecting the worst in people?

On the way back home, I hear a loud crack in the distance. Is today a holiday? Haven't seen any fireworks here yet. 
A minute later, a guy stops me in Turkish and then in English, saying I shouldn't go forward, as he saw someone running with a gun. 
A black mass of 20-30 people are moving erratically on a small basketball court in the park on my way.

it's still snowing, a few strangers, engaged in snowball fights, have thrown snowballs in my direction. In Russia it would feel rather hostile, but not here.

Our neighborhood has a lot of kids riding the slopes on plastic bags. That looks so joyous, that I join them, go too fast, fumble, crash into a sidewalk stairs and roll on the slope, hitting a few bones painfully enough, to start using smaller slopes.
I don't remember seeing whole neighborhoods participating in such snow galore. A christmas spirit.

## Day 8.  13.03.2022

A friend invited me to a local Soho House for breakfast.
In there, three French speakers(fluently conversing in English for my sake) casually trashed English language, noting how it's lacking beauty, elegance, or anything really.

Caught a cold. Allowing myself to rest instead of constantly stressing about rent and banks and jobs.

## Day 9.  14.03.2022

Had to leave last home for another one. More students, more foreign accents. Found a nice Lebanese restaurant. Sleeping on a sofa.

## Day 10.  15.03.2022

Making chinese style congee. Flatmates liked it so much, we've finished pot in one go.
